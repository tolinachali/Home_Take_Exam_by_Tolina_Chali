# Characterisation of miRBase
## Question 1: How many species are there in the current miRBase release?
# Answer
# Task 1: Number of species found in the current miRBase release
Total number of species: 271

This code reads a file containing biological data, extracts species codes, counts the occurrences of each species,
and visualizes the data in a bar chart. 

It also provides the total number of species and filters the data based on a threshold count of 300. 
The chart shows the number of microRNA per species in ascending order of counts.
## Task 2: generate an ordered plot (i.e. from lowest to highest) of number of miRNAs / species
## Answer: 
![an ordered plot  of number of miRNAs](https://github.com/tolinachali/Home_Take_Exam_by_Tolina_Chali/assets/130226558/cb614fc3-3ed7-4737-b6e0-ab0630d5471f)

## Question 2: how many let-7 miRNAs are there in the current release of miRBase
# Answer : 
Total number of let-7 miRNAs across all species: 740

Importance Counting "let-7" miRNAs
1. Analyzing a Specific miRNA:
2. Identifying Conservation:
3. Assessing miRNA Abundance: 
4. Investigating Disease Associations:
5. Comparative Analysis:
6. Dataset Validation:

Overall, the code's importance lies in its ability to count the occurrences of let-7 miRNAs, which enables the identification, characterization, and analysis of this particular microRNA family. By understanding the prevalence and functional relevance of let-7 miRNAs, researchers can advance their knowledge in diverse areas, ranging from basic biological research to disease-related investigations.
