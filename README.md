# Answer
Total number of species: 271

This code reads a file containing biological data, extracts species codes, counts the occurrences of each species, and visualizes the data in a bar chart. 
It also provides the total number of species and filters the data based on a threshold count of 300. 
The chart shows the number of microRNA per species in ascending order of counts.
