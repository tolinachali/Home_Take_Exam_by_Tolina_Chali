# Characterisation of miRBase
## Question 1: How many species are there in the current miRBase release?
## Answer
## Task 1: Number of species found in the current miRBase release
Total number of species: 271

This code reads a file containing biological data, extracts species codes, counts the occurrences of each species,
and visualizes the data in a bar chart. 

It also provides the total number of species and filters the data based on a threshold count of 300. 
The chart shows the number of microRNA per species in ascending order of counts.
## Task 2: generate an ordered plot (i.e. from lowest to highest) of number of miRNAs / species
## Answer: 
![an ordered plot  of number of miRNAs](https://github.com/tolinachali/Home_Take_Exam_by_Tolina_Chali/assets/130226558/cb614fc3-3ed7-4737-b6e0-ab0630d5471f)

## Question 2: how many let-7 miRNAs are there in the current release of miRBase
## Answer : 
Total number of let-7 miRNAs across all species: 740

Importance of the Code for Counting "let-7" miRNAs
1. Analyzing a Specific miRNA:

The code specifically focuses on the "let-7" microRNA. 
The let-7 family of microRNAs is known to play crucial roles in various biological processes, including development, 
cell differentiation, and cancer. 
By counting the occurrences of let-7 miRNAs, researchers can gain insights into their prevalence and potential
implications in different species.

2. Identifying Conservation:

The let-7 miRNA family is highly conserved across many species. 
By counting the occurrences of let-7 miRNAs across multiple species, researchers 
can identify and study the conservation of this particular microRNA. 
Conservation analysis provides valuable information about the functional importance
and evolutionary significance of a gene or regulatory element.

3. Assessing miRNA Abundance:

Counting the number of let-7 miRNAs can give insights into their abundance within a given dataset. 
Higher let-7 miRNA counts suggest a potential functional relevance of this miRNA in the studied biological context.
Understanding the abundance of specific miRNAs helps researchers prioritize their investigation and focus on 
the most prevalent and potentially significant molecules.

4. Investigating Disease Associations:

The dysregulation of miRNAs, including let-7, has been implicated in various diseases, including cancer 
and neurological disorders. 
Counting the occurrences of let-7 miRNAs across different species or within specific disease-related
datasets can help identify their potential role in disease development and progression.
This information can guide further investigations into the mechanisms underlying these diseases and 
aid in the development of diagnostic or therapeutic strategies.

5. Comparative Analysis:

By counting let-7 miRNAs across different species or experimental conditions, researchers can perform comparative analysis.
Comparing the counts of let-7 miRNAs can reveal differences in their expression or regulation, providing 
insights into species-specific or context-specific variations. 
Comparative analysis can contribute to our understanding of miRNA function and regulation in different biological systems.

6. Dataset Validation:

The code allows for the validation of miRNA datasets by confirming the presence of let-7 miRNAs. 
his step is crucial to ensure the accuracy and reliability of miRNA data. It helps researchers verify the expected
content of the dataset, especially when analyzing large-scale miRNA sequencing or expression data.

Overall, the code's importance lies in its ability to count the occurrences of let-7 miRNAs, which enables 
the identification, characterization, and analysis of this particular microRNA family. 
By understanding the prevalence and functional relevance of let-7 miRNAs, researchers 
can advance their knowledge in diverse areas, ranging from basic biological research to disease-related investigations.
