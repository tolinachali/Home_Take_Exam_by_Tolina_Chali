# Characterisation of miRBase
## Question 1: How many species are there in the current miRBase release?
# Answer
# Task 1: Number of species found in the current miRBase release
Total number of species: 271

This code reads a file containing biological data, extracts species codes, counts the occurrences of each species,
and visualizes the data in a bar chart. 

It also provides the total number of species and filters the data based on a threshold count of 300. 
The chart shows the number of microRNA per species in ascending order of counts.
## Task 2: generate an ordered plot (i.e. from lowest to highest) of number of miRNAs / species
## Answer: 
![an ordered plot  of number of miRNAs](https://github.com/tolinachali/Home_Take_Exam_by_Tolina_Chali/assets/130226558/cb614fc3-3ed7-4737-b6e0-ab0630d5471f)
